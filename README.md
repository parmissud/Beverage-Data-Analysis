# Beverage Data Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook designed for analyzing beverage-related data using Python and Pandas. The notebook fetches data from Google Drive and performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) to extract meaningful insights.

## Features
- Reads and processes beverage-related data from a CSV file stored in Google Drive.
- Utilizes Pandas for data manipulation and transformation.
- Displays data summaries and statistics.

## Methods
The analysis in this notebook follows these steps:
1. **Data Loading**: Fetches the dataset from Google Drive and loads it into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handles missing values, removes duplicates, and ensures data integrity.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Uses Pandas and visualization libraries to analyze trends and distributions.
4. **Statistical Analysis**: Computes descriptive statistics and identifies key insights from the data.
5. **Data Visualization**: Generates plots and charts for better understanding of the dataset.

## Techniques Used
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation, transformation, and cleaning.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For visualizing trends, distributions, and correlations in the data.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Mean, median, standard deviation, and other summary statistics.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Identifying relationships between different beverage attributes.
- **Data Imputation**: Handling missing values using statistical methods.
- **Outlier Detection**: Using IQR (Interquartile Range) and Z-score techniques.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
- Required Python libraries:
  ```sh
  pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
  ```

## How to Use
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`Beverage (2).ipynb`) in Google Colab or a local Jupyter environment.
2. Ensure the dataset is accessible from Google Drive.
3. Run the notebook cells to load, process, and analyze the data.
